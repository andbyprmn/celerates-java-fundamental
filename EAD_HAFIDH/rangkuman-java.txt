#VARIABLE DAN TIPE DATA

Variables are containers for storing data values.
In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

Syntax
type variable = value;


#CONSTANT VARIABLE

A constant is a variable whose value cannot change once it has been assigned. Java doesn't have built-in support for constants, but the variable modifiers static and final can be used to effectively create one.

Constants can make your program more easily read and understood by others. In addition, a constant is cached by the JVM as well as your application, so using a constant can improve performance. 

Static Modifier
This allows a variable to be used without first creating an instance of the class; a static class member is associated with the class itself, rather than an object. All class instances share the same copy of the variable.
This means that another application or main() can easily use it.
For example, class myClass contains a static variable days_in_week:

public class myClass {
   static int days_in_week = 7;
}
Because this variable is static, it can be used elsewhere without explicitly creating a myClass object:

public class myOtherClass {  
   static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println(myClass.days_in_week);
   }
 }

Final Modifier
The final modifier means that the variable's value cannot change. Once the value is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. 
Primitive data types (i.e., int, short, long, byte, char, float, double, boolean) can be made immutable/unchangeable using the final modifier.
Together, these modifiers create a constant variable.

static final int DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;

Note that we declared DAYS_IN_WEEK in all caps once we added the final modifier. It's a long-standing practice among Java programmers to define constant variables in all caps, as well as to separate words with underscores.
Java doesn't require this formatting but it makes it easier for anyone reading the code to immediately identify a constant.

#Operator
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

The value is called an operand, while the operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name		Description					Example	
+		Addition	Adds together two values			x + y	
-		Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another		x - y	
*		Multiplication	Multiplies two values				x * y	
/		Division	Divides one value from another			x / y	
%		Modulus	Returns the division remainder				x % y	
++		Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1		++x	
--		Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1		--x 


#KESIMPULAN
Varibel adalah sesuatu untuk menyimpan nilai suatu data.
Variabel Konstan adalah variabel yang nilainya tidak bisa diubah
Format melakukan Operasi Aritmatika:
<variable> = <variabel1> <operator> <variabel2>
